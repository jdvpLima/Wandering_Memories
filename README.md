# Wandering_Memories
Project created for the Master's Degree in Games, Graphics, and Interactive Systems.

This project was created in collaboration with a colleague, utilizing freely available assets found within a pixel art style, music free from royalties, and developed using Unity.

The game consists of a top-down shooter with 5 levels, broken by a narrative of a young man returning to his hometown.
It contains an endless mode and two different enemies.

Along with we were able to port the game to mobile phones and to the browser, along with being playable on the PC.
